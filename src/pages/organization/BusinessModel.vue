      In 2014, Tether was released for the first time. Tether is the first
      company in the world to produce the digital currency USDT, which is a
      stable digital currency and its value is 1USDT = 1USD.
      <br />
      <br />
      On March 5, 2019, the blockchain protocol TRON and the issuer of
      stablecoin TEDA announced cooperation. TRON introduced TEDA to the TRON
      network in 2019 and launched USDT based on TRC20. And co-founded TRU Lotto
      with TRON (a derivative project to increase the number of users and
      liquidity USDT).
      <br />
      <br />
      On February 21, 2021, the circulation of TRC20-USDT exceeded 14.2 billion.
      <br />
      <br />
      Binance is the world's largest digital currency exchange. In October 2019,
      Binance supported the USDT, developed based on the TRC20 protocol.
      <br />
      <br />
      As of January 25, 2022, the number of TRC20-USDT accounts exceeded 10
      million. Circulation of TRC20-USDT exceeded 36.7 billion
      <br />
      <br />
      We (TRUlotto) are a platform that helps each other because they (TEDA,
      TRON, Binance, etc.) need to increase the use of USDT and improve the
      liquidity of USDT, so these two companies found a team like us and created
      a platform like TRUlotto, they save on promotion costs to increase the
      number of users, and we can get a commission feedback that the company
      brings us (TRUlotto). Large companies such as TEDA, TRON and Binance have
      attracted users and increased USDT's liquidity. Then these companies give
      the money to the agents in the form of commissions, and yes, I am a member
      of the agents. (It's like in our real life, when the currency is not
      smooth, there will be inflation. When the currency is not circulating, the
      market economy is also in decline. At this time, the government will also
      come up with promotional measures to promote liquidity in a market
      economy).
      <br />
      <br />
      Agents receive commissions for your bets and deposits, so I need you to
      make a deposit and bets. Because the money you contribute will be borrowed
      and used by some of the sellers we work with, and these sellers will also
      pay online commissions on the loan, so these sellers will pay us part of
      the interest in the cooperation, and then our TRT platform will pay for
      you. guys.
      <br />
      And your bids will generate transactions, the higher the transaction
      volume (no loss due to price fluctuations in such transactions), the
      higher the commission we will receive, so you can earn 4% profit daily by
      giving Comes with high commissions, so we expect that you will receive a
      fixed profit from your bets every day.
      <br />
      <br />
      The more you bet, the more we get commissions, so we don't want any of you
      to lose, so I forbid you to play privately. Because once you lose your
      money, you will no longer have the opportunity to bet, and I will also
      lose a user who will be able to earn me a commission.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our platform can help you continue to increase the number of digital
      currencies and will not suffer losses from price fluctuations caused by
      transactions. When the price of a digital currency falls, your digital
      currency depreciates. We continue to increase the amount of digital
      currency for all, and even if the digital currency depreciates, it will
      make money by increasing the amount.
